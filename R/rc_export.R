#' @title Export Records from a REDCap Database
#' @description Exports records from a REDCap Database, allowing for 
#'   subsets of subjects, fields, records, and events. By default, all
#'   records will be exported. If a report ID is supplied, only data
#'   from that report will be exported. 
#'   
#' @param report_id Numeric. ID number for a report created in REDCap. 
#'   
#' @param url Character. A url address to connect to the REDCap API
#' @param token Character. Path to a text file containing your REDCap API token
#' @param data_dict Dataframe. REDCap project data data_dictionary. Required only
#' if the \code{format} or \code{form_complet_auto} options are \code{TRUE}. 
#' By default, this will be fetched from the REDCap bundle option, as created by 
#' \code{rc_bundle}.
#' @param id_field Character. The name of the record_id field for your REDCap project.
#' 
#' @param records Character. A vector of study id's to be returned.  If \code{NULL}, all 
#'   subjects are returned.
#' @param fields Character. A vector of fields to be returned.  If \code{NULL}, 
#'   all fields are returned.
#' @param forms Character. A vector of forms to be returned.  If \code{NULL}, 
#'   all forms are returned.
#' @param events Character. A vector of events to be returned from a longitudinal database.
#'   If \code{NULL}, all events are returned.
#' @param filter_logic Character. Optional logic filter for record exports. Use REDCap
#'  style syntax- ie. similar to branching logic, calculations, etc.
#' @param survey Logical. Specifies whether or not to export the survey identifier field 
#'   (e.g., "redcap_survey_identifier") or survey timestamp fields 
#'   (e.g., form_name+"_timestamp") when surveys are utilized in the project. 
#'   If you do not pass in this flag, it will default to "false". If set to 
#'   "true", it will return the redcap_survey_identifier field and also the 
#'   survey timestamp field for a particular survey when at least 
#'   one field from that survey is being exported. NOTE: If the survey 
#'   identifier field or survey timestamp fields are imported via API data 
#'   import, they will simply be ignored since they are not real fields in 
#'   the project but rather are pseudo-fields.
#' @param dag Logical. Specifies whether or not to export the "redcap_data_access_group" 
#'   field when data access groups are utilized in the project. If you do not 
#'   pass in this flag, it will default to "false". NOTE: This flag is only 
#'   viable if the user whose token is being used to make the API request is 
#'   *not* in a data access group. If the user is in a group, then this 
#'   flag will revert to its default value.
#' @param form_complete_auto Logical. If \code{fields} are passed,
#' REDCap does not return form complete fields unless specifically requested.
#' However, if \code{TRUE}, the \code{[form]_complete} fields for any form 
#' from which at least one variable is requested will automatically be 
#' retrieved.
#'   
#' @param format Logical.  Determines whether the data will be formatted with
#' \code{rc_format} using the default options (Default = FALSE)
#' @param ... Additional arguments to be passed to \code{rc_api_call}. Any arguments
#'   accepted by the API may be passed, even if not pre-coded by this function.
#' @param strip Logical. If \code{TRUE}, empty rows and columns will be removed from
#' record_data. See \code{rc_strip} for more information or call seperately for more
#' options. 
#' 
#' @param batch_size Integer.  Specifies the number of subjects to be included 
#'   in each batch of a batched export.  Non-positive numbers export the 
#'   entire project in a single batch. Batching the export may be beneficial 
#'   to prevent tying up smaller servers.  See details for more explanation.
#' 
#' @details
#' A record of exports through the API is recorded in the Logging section 
#' of the project.
#' 
#' It is unnecessary to include "redcap_event_name" or the "redcap_repeat" variables
#' in the fields argument. These fields are automatically exported for any 
#' longitudinal database. If the user does include them in the fields argument, 
#' they are removed quietly in the parameter checks.
#' 
#' A 'batched' export is one where the export is performed over a series of 
#' API calls rather than one large call.  For large projects on small servers, 
#' this may prevent a single user from tying up the server and forcing others 
#' to wait on a larger job.  The batched export is performed by first 
#' calling the API to export the subject identifier field (the first field
#' in the meta data).  The unique ID's are then assigned a batch number with 
#' no more than \code{batch_size} ID's in any single batch.  The batches are 
#' exported from the API and stacked together.
#' 
#' In longitudinal projects, \code{batch_size} may not necessarily be the 
#' number of records exported in each batch.  If \code{batch_size} is 10 and 
#' there are four records per patient, each batch will consist of 40 records.  
#' Thus, if you are concerned about tying up the server with a large, 
#' longitudinal project, it would be prudent to use a smaller batch size.
#' 
#'  
#' Note about export rights (6.0.0+): Please be aware that Data Export user rights will be 
#' applied to this API request. For example, if you have "No Access" data export rights 
#' in the project, then the API data export will fail and return an error. And if you 
#' have "De-Identified" or "Remove all tagged Identifier fields" data export rights, 
#' then some data fields *might* be removed and filtered out of the data set returned 
#' from the API. To make sure that no data is unnecessarily filtered out of your API 
#' request, you should have "Full Data Set" export rights in the project.
#' 
#' REDCap Version:
#' >= 6.0.0 
#' 
#' Deidentified Batched Calls:
#' Batched calls to the API are not a feature of the REDCap API, but may be imposed 
#' by making multiple calls to the API.  The process of batching the export requires
#' that an initial call be made to the API to retrieve only the record IDs.  The
#' list of IDs is then broken into chunks, each about the size of \code{batch_size}.
#' The batched calls then force the \code{records} argument in each call.
#' 
#' When a user's permissions require a de-identified data export, a batched call 
#' should be expected to fail.  This is because, upon export, REDCap will hash the 
#' identifiers.  When R attempts to pass the hashed identifiers back to REDCap, 
#' REDCap will try to match the hashed identifiers to the unhashed identifiers in the
#' database.  No matches will be found, and the export will fail.
#' 
#' Users who are exporting de-identified data will have to settle for using unbatched
#' calls to the API (ie, \code{batch_size = -1})
