\usage{
rc_missing(
  record_data,
  completion_field = NULL,
  repeats = NULL,
  bundle = getOption("redcap_bundle"),
  data_dict = getOption("redcap_bundle")$data_dict,
  events = getOption("redcap_bundle")$event_data$unique_event_name,
  form_perm = getOption("redcap_bundle")$form_perm,
  mappings = getOption("redcap_bundle")$mappings,
  id_field = getOption("redcap_bundle")$id_field
)
}
\arguments{
\item{record_data}{Record data export from REDCap}

\item{completion_field}{Character. The REDCap variable which indicates whether or not a subject
has completed the study. This should be indicated by a 'Yes' or a '1' (i.e. a Yes/No
field in REDCap). If not provided, some missing data may be lost.}

\item{repeats}{Character. A vector of repeat instrument names which should be kept. This should
ONLY be used for repeat instruments which are expected to have a consistent number of occurrences
per each event/ID combination. All repeat instruments not supplied here will be removed to avoid
excessive false positives.}

\item{bundle}{List. A project metadata bundle as created by \code{rc_bundle}. By default, the
bundle is expected in the option "redcap_bundle". This option exists so that all of the required
metadata can be supplied in a single argument.}

\item{data_dict}{Dataframe. REDCap project data data_dictionary. By default,
$data_dict is expected in a REDCap bundle object, as created by \code{rc_bundle}. Otherwise, an
equivalent data.frame containing the project data dictionary must be supplied.}

\item{events}{Character. Vector of REDCap event names. If supplying manually, chronological
ordering of events must be ensured.}

\item{form_perm}{Dataframe. User access permissions for REDCap forms. By default, $form_perm
is expected in the REDCap bundle, as created by \code{rc_bundle}. Otherwise, an equivalent
data.frame containing form permission data must be supplied.}

\item{mappings}{Dataframe. Redcap metadata that maps forms to events.}

\item{id_field}{Character. The name of the record_id field for your REDCap project.}
}
\description{
Finds data points which are ostensibly missing from Redcap records data.

For each event/variable combination, if a value exists for at least one
record then it is expected to exist for all records. Any event or variable which is empty within
the entire dataframe will inherently be dropped. If an event has no values for a given record,
none of the variables will be flagged unless there is data for that record in the following event.
Additionally, if the subject is marked as having completed the study (i.e. \code{completion_field 
== 'Yes'|1}), then empty events for that subject will not be discarded.

The logic of this function does not extend to repeat instruments or checkbox, calculated,
or hidden fields. If present in the record data, they will be dropped. Additionally, this function
does not yet support branching logic. It will be implemented in a future version.
